# PokeAP-proj
Pokemon AP performance task for AP CSP

This program was partially a web API test

-How to install-

This is merely just a webpage, so all you *need* to do is just download and open the pokeproj.html file
The rest are technically optional, but they do improve the user experience and overall finish of the page
But the whole functionality is provided with just the one file

-How to use the program-

There isn't a whole lot of functionality, you can either get a random pokemon and have
its info shown on screen OR you can switch the region you're searching within.

Common mistake I see people talk about, which I totally understand, is that it doesnt
search specifically just the region selected. But it searches all available pokemon
available within the region.

This is my first project not only on github but like, also pretty much my first *real* project ive made.
I know it could be improved, Im learning more about computer science and programming overall
Im working with Java mostly now, so thats different. Anyways I know nobodys gonna even read this so Im
just yapping at this point. I have no idea how to make a good readme, what do I look like... A programmer?
Honestly I dont even know how this site works, thats why theres the fucked up 7z folder

Anyways, thx for reading
